## About Me

Hi! I'm Kien Huynh, a data analyst with a background in Economics and Finance, and professional experience in business operations and production planning. I graduated from RMIT University with a strong academic record and developed an interest in using data to solve complex business problems. Over the past few years, I’ve managed supply chains and optimized production schedules across hundreds of SKUs.

My transition into data analytics has been supported by hands-on projects involving Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel. I’ve applied these tools to tasks like churn prediction, customer segmentation, and performance analysis—translating data into insights that support better decision-making.

This portfolio showcases selected projects that reflect both my analytical skills and my practical experience in operations and business environments.
