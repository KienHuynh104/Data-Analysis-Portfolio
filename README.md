# Kien Huynh – Data Analyst Portfolio (Python, SQL, Power BI, Excel)
___

## I.About Me

Hi! I'm Kien Huynh, a data analyst with a background in Economics and Finance, and professional experience in business operations and production planning. I graduated from RMIT University with a strong academic record and developed an interest in using data to solve complex business problems. Over the past few years, I’ve managed supply chains and optimized production schedules across hundreds of SKUs.

My transition into data analytics has been supported by hands-on projects involving Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel. I’ve applied these tools to tasks like churn prediction, customer segmentation, and performance analysis—translating data into insights that support better decision-making.

This portfolio showcases selected projects that reflect both my analytical skills and my practical experience in operations and business environments.

## II.Portfolio Projects
### 1.Python
#### 1.1 Telco Customer Churn Prediction
**Situation**: A telecommunications company faced rising customer churn and needed a way to identify at-risk users and improve retention strategies using customer data.

**Task**: Develop a predictive machine learning model using demographic and service usage data to classify customers likely to churn, and identify key contributing factors.

**Skills**:Data preprocessing, handling missing values,addressing class imbalance with SMOTE, feature selection with SelectKBest, model training, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation using F1 Score, precision, recall, business insight extraction from feature importance

**Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SMOTE (imblearn), GridSearchCV

**Result**  
- Trained and compared 5 models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost  
- XGBoost performed best:  
  - **F1 Score:** 0.801  
  - **Accuracy:** 79.8%  
- Identified **Contract Type**, **Paperless Billing**, and **Online Security** as key churn indicators  
- Recommended offering long-term contracts and improving service engagement to reduce churn

## IV.Certificates
I believe the most meaningful way to demonstrate skills is through real projects and shared results. While certificates aren’t the focus of my learning, they often come as a natural outcome of exploring and practicing new tools. Most of what I’ve learned has come from self-study and hands-on work, reflecting a strong independent mindset and a commitment to continuous growth.
